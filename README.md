# CS354 Database Project
Database (CS354) Project under Dr. Samrat Mondal

The objective of this project is to make a publication and project management system for IITP faculty. This will allow easy tracking and management of all publications in the institute.

Check out the [report](report.pdf) to know more.

## Instructions to run the project:
Install a LAMP stack. Place these files in `/var/www/html` directory. You also have to create a supporting database. A [sample database](publication_project_db.sql) has been included. Now everything should be accessible via a web browser.
